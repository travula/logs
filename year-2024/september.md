1. [ ] List the work in terms of bulding portals and
       services to establish a supply chain for certain
       organic prroducts as a union of microservices that
       are calibrating the value of their labor on a
       constant basis and in real time as a dynamic
       allocation of a resource towards a more organic
       society. Does this become a study of alzebraic
       structures? Learn about alzebra in terms of
       structures and operations. For example, `f(x.y) =
       f(x). f(y)`.  Venkatesh is working on implementing in
       a functional language the operations on vector
       spaces. 
2. [ ] Finish up the finances. How am I placed? Create a
       roadmap for all your work, in terms of kids
       education, agriculture, generating revenue through
       direct buyers, the later has to be estimated in the
       plan to continue these two primary activities. How we
       do we also generate revenue in the building of
       services to form a union to cater to another
       need. Like extending it to form a union of security
       workers as an worker operated enterprise.  The
       portals and services for `coopious` allows other
       producers to utilize the platform.  A revenue stream
       is established for such transactions through an open
       deterministic method applied between consumers and
       producers at every stage.  

3. [ ] Prepare a map of current finances and activities
       selected to define equifinality.  Also prepare a
       report or a write up on these choices and how they
       are arrived at. Define it as a set of rational
       choices? This should be interesting while aligning
       the cause with the action.
