# Wed, Oct 23, 2024
1. [ ] Finish the REACT tutorial.  
       - I should log how many hours I clocked on this task.  
       - I should restrict to 0 hours to browsing.  
       - Status:  
          1. worked out the state machine formula, `F(Xi,
         Yi) = Yi+1` and the projection dfinition - `H(Yi)
         = Zi`, where `Zi` is the `ith` view.  
          2. After, that looked at the `TeX` to write these
             formulae.  I will have to start learning by
             wrting in `LATex` the problem statement for a
             virtual lab on cooperatives.  
          3. Probably logged 3 hours. After that kids came.

1. [ ] Work on the REACT tutorial.
   - Status: Nothing happened. There was no progress on this
     task. I am self reflecting.  There is a total stop to
     using cell phone for social media and browsing and the
     computer for browsing random stuff. I spent an hour
     yesterday on these tasks. I should reduce them to zero.
