## Summary
I did not somehow get to work on the tasks I set up. I just
whiled away time and read other stuff that is not really
pertinent to the immediate objectives that I set for myself.
The immediate goal to be realized is to build the portal and
finish the `probability and calculus` math courses.  It has
been quite some time that I ahve worked at desk sitting for
long hours.  I need to make this a practise and complete the
`react` tutorial and start building the portal.  This is
definitely in my hands.  To help realise this, I will have
to setup a timetable and strictly follow it.
