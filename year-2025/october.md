## Tasks
- [ ] Work on the PL part III, spend 8 hours on it today.
  - Did not work on it.  I will have to take it seriously.
    Once this is completed, I can start working on building
    a portal and also get talking to Devi and collaborate to
    get the platform done.
- [X] play with the kids and go for a run with them.
  - talked to them, read with them, went for a 10k run in
    the evening.  

## Plan Ahead
Yamini and I talked about getting the room on the south west
redone and a new kitchen built.  Currently, Rajita my step
mother is of the idea that the new kitchen that we are
planning to build will be entirely used by her.  This was
conveyed by Karuna vadina.  Yamini also thinks that it is
better for her to give her own space than impinge ourselves
upon her.  Her proposal is to build it with the twin objectives:  
1. sure prospect that we will be using the kitchen in the
   future and
2. plan and built it thinking my father would use and leave
   out the baggage that my step mon would use it.
   
We will have to work out the cost and the finances for this
construction.  Once this is achieved, it will be possible to
take up the drainage, electric wiring of our ancestral house
and get it into a nice shape so that all of us are
comfortable
and happy.

## Tasks

- [ ] Work on the PL part III and try to finish before I
      leave Chityal.
  - notes on visibility is updated and duck typing video is
    completed.  Duck typing is polymorphism specific to
    dynamically typed languages.  I did not make a note of
    number of hours I worked on this task, may be couple of
    hours.  I will have to make it 8 hours a day. 
- [X] Thrash and winnow the green gram
  - Somaiah and I completed this task.  The yield was only
    20 kgs.  The initial lack of rain immediately after
    sowwing did not allow the plant to grow after sowing and
    continuous rain later allowed multiple weeds grow along.
    When the crop was ready for harvest, the rains did not
    relent, and half of the crop was soaked.  But the silver
    line is the growth of stylo hamata. 
- [X] Leave to Hyderabad
  - Reached home at by 9:30 PM.  It is a great feeling to be
    hugged by the kids and looking at Yamini.

## Tasks
- [ ] Work on the PL part III and try to finish before I
      leave Chityal.  
  - worked on it for few hours.  It is not the pace that is
    desired.  I will have to quantify the effort from now
    onwards.  Instead watched `One Battle After Another`.
    Try to set time for browsing and calls and do it mostly
    during this time.  
- [X] Get the rice bags from the mill for sifting.  
  - Drove tractor to the rice mill and got the bags.  I did
    not count the bags while mill help was loading.  When we
    were unloading it was noticed three bags were still
    lying at the mill.  I got them in an auto and all the
    bags are stacked in the south west room of the house.  
- [X] Coordinate with male laborers to set the pipe right.
  - The pipe is set properly.  The water from the canal when
    at a lower is flowing into the field now.  After this
    task completed, they came home and laid the pipe
    undergroud to the water tank for cattle from the sump.
- [ ] Plan to go to Hyderabad.
  - Thought of going in the evening, but forgot about the
    task of thrushing and winnowing green gram.  This was
    slip in the planning. 

## Plan Ahead

Get the rice sifted to remove the husk. Calculate the finances and
the burn rate.  On the next visit to Chityal, get the mason
and make the estimation to get the room ready.  Then, I will
plan to get the kitchen ready using stabilized mud bricks.
During the next week, during free cycles start writing the
draft for the platform.

## Tasks
- [ ] Work on the PL part III and try to finish before I
      leave Chityal.  
  - Worked couple of hours last evening.  I should be more
    focussed. Finished couple of lectures.  
      
- [X] After the green gram is picked get the bags to the
      cattle shed  
  - Three bags are brought home, the other will be brought
    tomorrow.  5 women came today to pick the green gram.

## Plan Ahead

Tomorrow, the green gram should be thrushed and winnowed.  I
should get the rice bags from the mill for winnowing of
husk.  Yakamma and other person should be able to do this
while I am away in Hyderabad.  I should be able to leave
tomorrow evening.  

About the guard at the mango garden, I will extend him to
stay another month till 13th November.  This month his
function will be to guard the garden from the sheep grazing
in it.  During this time, he should also ensure the
fencing is fixed in places where it fell apart.  

The male workers would come tomorrow to set the pipeline to
the ammapuricheri from the canal.  The pipeline did not sit
properly in the trench due to the water gushing out from the
canal when the pipeline was laid initially.

## Tasks and their Status

- [X] Work with the laborers, may be most of the day while
      picking green gram pods.  
  - Three women have turned up.  There is not much green
    gram to be picked.  Whatever there is, it is sparse.
    They could not pick even to cover their wages.  So, the
    plan is to employ another three for tomorrow and work on
    areas where it green gram is in little abundance and
    wrap up the picking.

- [X] Complete the page to provide details of the rice
      varieties and an order form.  Later to share the
      hyperlink with Venkatesh.  
  - [The
    page](https://travula.github.io/coopious-2025/rice.html)
    is given to Venkatesh.  

- [X] Create the list of prople who have already placed the
      orders.  
  - The [spread
    sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YDC1iYJN1Q-j2xWHp7oOR9w7oLIPF7xVHBDZoqQIlOc/edit?usp=drive_link)
    is shared with Yamini.  

- [ ] Work on the PL part III and try to finish before I
      leave Chityal.
      
  - I did not work on this.  I whiled away some time on the
    internet watching youtube videos.  This should be
    stopped.

# Mon, Oct 6, 2025

Came back from Hyderabad after dropping Yamini and kids at
Hyderabad yesterday.  I started from Hyderabad in the
morning and reached Chityal by 11:00 AM.  The purpose of
coming back is to harvest green gram.  Women who will pick
the green gram pods were not interested in sharing the crop
for their labor in 50:50 ratio.  Therefore, changed our
terms to pay them in daily wage of Rs 300/-.  We thought we
should try with 5 women to see the pace of their activity and
calibrate accordingly for the next few days and complete the
activity.
