## Tasks
- [ ] Work on the PL part III and try to finish before I
      leave Chityal.
  - Worked couple of hours last evening.  I should be more
    focussed. Finished couple of lectures.
      
- [X] After the green gram is picked get the bags to the
      cattle shed  
  - Three bags are brought home, the other will be brought
    tomorrow.  5 women came today to pick the green gram.

## Plan Ahead

Tomorrow, the green gram should be thrushed and winnowed.  I
should get the rice bags from the mill for winnowing of
husk.  Yakamma and other person should be able to do this
while I am away in Hyderabad.  I should be able to leave
tomorrow evening.  

About the guard at the mango garden, I will extend him to
stay another month till 13th November.  This month his
function will be to guard the garden from the sheep grazing
in it.  During this time, he should also ensure the
fencing is fixed in places where it fell apart.  

The male workers would come tomorrow to set the pipeline to
the ammapuricheri from the canal.  The pipeline did not sit
properly in the trench due to the water gushing out from the
canal when the pipeline was laid initially.

## Tasks and their Status

- [X] Work with the laborers, may be most of the day while
      picking green gram pods.
      - Three women have turned up.  There is not much green
        gram to be picked.  Whatever there is, it is sparse.
        They could not pick even to cover their wages.  So,
        the plan is to employ another three for tomorrow and
        work on areas where it green gram is in little
        abundance and wrap up the picking.

- [X] Complete the page to provide details of the rice
      varieties and an order form.  Later to share the
      hyperlink with Venkatesh.  
  - [The
    page](https://travula.github.io/coopious-2025/rice.html)
    is given to Venkatesh.  

- [X] Create the list of prople who have already placed the
      orders.  
  - The [spread
    sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YDC1iYJN1Q-j2xWHp7oOR9w7oLIPF7xVHBDZoqQIlOc/edit?usp=drive_link)
    is shared with Yamini.  

- [ ] Work on the PL part III and try to finish before I
      leave Chityal.
      
  - I did not work on this.  I whiled away some time on the
    internet watching youtube videos.  This should be
    stopped.

# Mon, Oct 6, 2025

Came back from Hyderabad after dropping Yamini and kids at
Hyderabad yesterday.  I started from Hyderabad in the
morning and reached Chityal by 11:00 AM.  The purpose of
coming back is to harvest green gram.  Women who will pick
the green gram pods were not interested in sharing the crop
for their labor in 50:50 ratio.  Therefore, changed our
terms to pay them in daily wage of Rs 300/-.  We thought we
should try with 5 women to see the pace of their activity and
calibrate accordingly for the next few days and complete the
activity.
