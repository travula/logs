## Activities
Today, Somaiah and I tried to fix the pipes that were
getting unfastened at Gadila Peradu.  We felt it is futile
to try to fix them with the solution and ordered HDPE pipe
of 75 m length.  This length will allow the water to be
pumped to the field.  From here, pvc pipes are to be used to
move water to different areas within the field.

Later in the afternoon, Somaiah fixed the bunds to enable
water to stay in the fields. I worked on transplanting
certain saplings that were stamped out by ergets.

Yesterday, we laid pipeline from the SRSP canal to the
field.  There should be sufficient water now. The plan for
the next few days is 
1. to plant vertiver slips,
2. the HDPE pipe will be arriving in couple of days, fix it
3. I do not know if milling of rice will be possible.

|:-----------------------|---------------:|
| Cool Drink for Sandeep |             70 |
| Whisky for Somaiah     |            110 |
| Total                  |            180 |


## Activities

Today the plan was to plant vertiver slips at Ramrothu
polam.  This did not go as planned. When we went there, the
motor was running but the water in the well has gone below
the level of football.  We do not know for how long the
motor had been running without drawing water.  Somaiah
switched off the motor and checked the water in the potti
somaiah's polam. 

We came back later after early lunch and moved the motor
another 10 meters down with the help of Sandeep.  It was hot
in the afternoon and the motor and the pipe were heavy.
Though Somaiah and I could release the motor down using a
rope, we had to unscrew the botton suction pipe. It was a
struggle to join the suction pipe back since it had water
and was heavy and could not align holes to the bolts of the
motor.  We called Sandeep and he came in handy.  Finally we
were able to join the suction pipe and also the output pipe.

Later in the evening, I came back and gave water and fodder
to the cattle.  Somaiah, after his late lunch came back and
cleared the dung.  We also covered the septic tank with a
new cover that was broken.

It rained a little bit which is good for the perennial tuar
seeds that were sowed a few days back.

The plan for tomorrow is to plant the vertiver slips at
Ramrothu polam and later in the mango orchard in the
afternoon.

## Activities

Checked water in gadila peradu and marri bavi peradu.  The
HDPE that is ordered has not arrived yet.  Therefore, the
water from the bore is being diverted to gadila peradu and
Akbar's motor is used to water marri bavi peradu.  At
Ramarothu polam, the motor that was fixed y'day is pumping
water.  It is a relief.  Around 200 slips of vertiver were
transplanted.  After lunch another 100 were transplanted at
mango orchard. 

It occured to me that after kharif, both the peradu lands
be transplanted with vertiver with a meter spacing.  With
this spacing, one acre would require around 4200 slips.

The plan for tomorrow is to plant the remaining vertiver
slips and check the water in the fields at the peradu and
ammapuri cheri.

## Activities
The planting of vertiver slips is completed today.  Funny -
one of the bulls that is castrated few months back could not
get up in the morning.  When we made it to stand up, it
stood with pain in one of the rear legs.  The compounder
came in later and adminstered pain killer and anti
inflammation injections.  In the evening the pain subsided
but is not fully recovered.  The same injections will be
given tomorrow.

Somaiah checked the water in Ammapuri cheri and he observed
that the bund at the downward slope of a field is leaking
with lot of holes.  His plan is to rectify this by creating
another smaller bund adjacent to the existing one.

# Activities
Today, I talked to Somaiah on the phone.  it rained heavily
last night.  The plan was to sow perennial tuar in mango
garden.  Looks like Yakamma did not turn up.  Somaiah worked
on laying the smaller bund.  It is not completed yet.  

I met with Arun and discussed about the platform to for
organic produce.  They already have a frontend created in
wordpress.  I would like to add use this to sell rice and
build from there.
